      <h3>Look <em>very carefully</em> through this HTML file</h3>

      <p>Throughout the file, there are <b>lots</b> of mistakes.
      It is up to you to find and correct all of the bugs in the code so that it works properly.</p>

      <p>This isn't meant to be easy, but it will help you build your debugging skills.</p>

      <h4>So, what's debugging, and why is it important?</h4>

      <p>Debugging is the process of looking through code very carefully to find
        where the code isn't written correctly. With HTML, an example of
        an error that you may look for is that all tags needing to be closed
        are actually closed. More of types of errors later... </p>

      <p>With programming, this skill comes in handy on a regular basis. As you
        understand the errors in your code more, you will improve on your programming
        skills, have a deep understanding of how to properly write code, and be able
        to write code faster.
      </p>

      <p>For this exercise, follow your instinct. If something just "feels"
        wrong in the code, look into it a bit deeper. Understand why the code is
        written in a certain way and determine if there is a problem with it.
        Most importantly, you should try to understand <em>WHY</em> there could be a
        problem with the code.  Use the internet to find answers to the questions
        that will come up during this exercise.  One helpful site is
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools.</a> You can
        also check out <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>
        as well.</p>

      <div class="instruction-guidelines">
        <h3>Here are some tips on looking for bugs:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pay close attention to HTML tags that must be closed</li>
          <li>For self-closing HTML tags, make sure the syntax is correct</li>
          <li>Ensure that an HTML element is used in the correct order (like with &#60;td&#62; and &#60;tr&#62; tags)</li>
          <li>Make sure that image paths are correct or they will not work (look up relative and absolute paths)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>So, now that you understand what debugging is, let's get started! Below, I'll
        have lots of different errors. Lots of them are repeats. Good luck in your
        quest to fix this bad code!</p>
