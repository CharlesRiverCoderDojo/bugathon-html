      <h3>Look <em>very carefully</em> through this HTML file</h3>

      <p>Throughout the file, there are <b>lots</b> of mistakes.
      It is up to you to find and correct all of the bugs in the code so that it works properly.</p>

      <p>This isn't meant to be easy, but it will help you build your debugging skills.</p>

      <h4>So, what's debugging, and why is it important?</h4>

      <p>Debugging is the process of looking through code very carefully to find
        where the code isn't written correctly. With HTML code, an example of
        an error that you may look for is that all tags that need to be closed
        are actually closed. More of types of errors later... </p>

      <p>With programming, this skill comes in handy on a regular basis. As you
        understand the errors in your code more, you will improve on your programming
        skills, have a deep understanding of how to properly write code, and be able
        to write code faster.
      </p>

      <p>For this exercise, follow your instinct, and if something just "feels"
        wrong in the code, look into it a bit deeper. Understand why the code is
        written in a certain way and determine if there is a problem with it.
        Importantly, you should try to understand <em>WHY</em> there could be a
        problem with the code.  Use the internet to find answers to the questions
        that will come up during this exercise.  One helpful site is
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools.</a> You can
        also check out <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>
        as well.</p>

      <div class="instruction-guidelines">
        <h3>Here are some tips on looking for bugs:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><i class="fa fa-bell-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay close attention to HTML tags that must be closed</li>
          <li><i class="fa fa-binoculars" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For self-closing HTML tags, make sure the syntax is correct</li>
          <li><i class="fa fa-anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure that an HTML element is being implemented correctly (hint, hint the list item tag)</li>
          <li><i class="fa fa-hand-pointer-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With styling, make sure that an element is being selected as a class or an id</li>
          <li><i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check that styling of an element isn't getting overwritten by an element lower in the cascade</li>
          <li><i class="fa fa-tachometer" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open up your web inspector (option + command + i on a Mac, and control + shift + i on a PC) to directly update CSS while in the browser</li>
          <li><i class="fa fa-cogs" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're interested in learning about Font Awesome, check out this link here: <a href="http://fontawesome.io/examples/" target="_blank">Font Awesome Examples</a></li>

      <p>So, now that you understand what debugging is, let's get started! Below, I'll
        have lots of different errors. Lots of them are repeats. Good luck in your
        quest to fix this bad code!</p>

      <h4>If you are looking for an extra challenge...</h4>
      <p>Remove the commented code at the bottom of this file. You will have
      a JavaScript challenge to take on. As with the content and styling, find the bugs, but this
      time the errors are in the script.js file!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="challenge-form">
      <h3 class="challenge-intro">Hello, ninja.  For your extra challenge,
      you will be learning a bit about algorithms.</h3>
      <h4>So, what <em class="underline">exactly</em> is an alogrithm?</h4>
     <p>To say <span class="uppercase">exactly</span> what Wikipedia says- it's a self-contained sequence of
     actions to be performed. Huh?? Basically, it's a series of steps that you take to reach a
     very specific goal. So, don't worry about content or styling in this extra challenge-
     think about the way your code functions when a user interacts with it.</p>
     <br />
     <p><em class="bold underline">Think about it- your life is a series of algorithms.</em></p>
     <br />
     <p>For example, you have an algorithm you follow every time
     you brush your teeth. Go into the bathroom, grab your toothbrush, turn on the water,
     wet your toothbrush, turn off the water, put toothpaste on your toothbrush,
     brush those beautiful teeth, etc. It's as easy as that! Well, easy may sometimes be an overstatement...
     <a href="http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~jrbirge/html/dholmes/StoProIntro.html" target="_blank">Oy...</a></p>
     <br />
     <p>Algorithms can get pretty complicated, but they're not always <em>that</em> complicated. Take a few minutes to think about some of
     the algorithms that dominate your life. What is your algorithm for having dinner?
     What is the algorithm you follow just to turn on your computer?</p>
     <br />
     <p>Algorithms are <em class="underline">very</em> helpful in programming. Like, do you see
     the &lsaquo;em&rsaquo; tag and underline class that I'm using to emphasize how helpful they are?? They are the recipes that you can use to create
     your fantastic programs. They will help you build the foundation of code that you need for your site and make it applicable to many different situations. For
     example, if Laura and Kate have the same tooth-brushing routine, you can use that
     one tooth-brushing algorithm to represent that process for both people. A more generic example is that you can use an
     algorithm to calculate the number of days a person has been alive since their
     date of birth. So, you would take any one person's date of birth and figure out how many
     days that person has existed since today's date. Or you can sort a random series of numbers from the
     smallest to the largest. What would be an interesting algorithm that you could create based on your life?</p>
     <br />
     <p>By creating an algorithm, you will save time programming, and
     your code will be D.R.Y.- Don't Repeat Yourself. If you're interested, look up DRY programming.</p>
     <br />
     <p>We'll start you off with a cool JavaScript algorithm.</p>
     <br />
     <p><span class="uppercase">Here's the challenge:</span> you are going to have a user enter her or his name
     into the form below. When the user puts their name into the form, you will have an
     algorithm that displays their name spelled backwards.</p>
     <br />
     <p>What makes this an algorithm? Well, we want the code to do the same
       thing every time a name/string is entered into the input field. We want
       consistency when our code responds to the users' input.</p>
       <br />
       <p> Here are some things to think about as you're fixing this code:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>You need to make sure the user name is saved as a variable</li>
       <li>Look into jQuery methods (a method is a built-in function) that can manipulate
       strings</li>
       <li>Review what 'method chaining' means- putting one method after another- it's very helpful! <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_chaining.asp" target="_blank">Look here!</a></li>
       <li>You will need a method that can cut a word into individual letters <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp" target="_blank"> like here</a></li>
       <li>Another method that you may need would swap all of the letters from their original place <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reverse.asp" target="_blank">like here</a></li>
       <li>Another method could put those individual letters back together to create another string <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_join.asp" target="_blank">like here</a></li>
       <li>There are two JavaScript functions here that you can fix. Try the first one, and then go on to the second one if you'd like.  We can chat
       about these a bit in our next meeting!</li>
     </ul>
