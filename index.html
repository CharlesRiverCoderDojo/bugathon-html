    <h1><span class="uppercase">This is your mission, ninja,</span></h1>
    <h2>should you choose to accept it.</h2>
    <div class="instruction-overview">
      <h3>Look <em>very carefully</em> through this HTML file and the attached CSS file...</h3>
      <p>Throughout both files, there are <span class="bold uppercase">lots</span> of mistakes.  In fact,
      there are 10 mistakes that have been made in each file. It is up to you to find and correct all of
      the bugs in the code so that it works properly.</p>
      <br />
      <p>This isn't meant to be easy, but it will help you build your debugging skills. So, what's debugging, and why is it important?
      Well, it's very rare that all of the code you create will be free of errors, or that
      code that you work with as a developer will be free of errors.  That's why it is important
      to train yourself to recognize errors in code and understand why that block of
      code needs to be changed. That's the essence of debugging- find an error in the
      code that you're working with and fix it.</p>
      <br />
      <p>For this exercise, follow your instinct, and if something
      just "feels" wrong in the code, figure out why. Understand why the code is written in a certain way
      and fix it if you find a problem with it. Try turning off or disabling any linter packages
      that may be enabled in your text editor of choice. If you run into questions or are
      having trouble, you should search the internet for answers to your questions. One
      helpful site is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools.</a>
      You can also check out <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> as well.</p>

      <p>Below are some images that show what the site is supposed to look like:</p>

      <h3>Here are some tips on looking for bugs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><i class="fa fa-bell-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay close attention to HTML tags that must be closed</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-binoculars" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For self-closing HTML tags, make sure the syntax is correct</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure that an HTML element is being implemented correctly (hint, hint the list item tag)</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-hand-pointer-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With styling, make sure that an element is being selected as a class or an id</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check that styling of an element isn't getting overwritten by an element lower in the cascade</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-tachometer" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open up your web inspector (option + command + i on a Mac, and control + shift + i on a PC) to directly update CSS while in the browser</li>

      <h4>If you are looking for an extra challenge...</h4>
      <p>Remove the commented code at the bottom of this file. You will have
      a JavaScript challenge to take on. As with the content and styling, find the bugs, but this
      time the errors are in the script.js file!</p>
    </div>

    <!-- <div class="challenge-form">
      <h3 class="challenge-intro">Hello, ninja.  For your extra challenge,
      you will be learning a bit about algorithms.</h3>
      <h4>So, what <em class="underline">exactly</em> is an alogrithm?</h4>
     <p>To say <span class="uppercase">exactly</span> what Wikipedia says- it's a self-contained sequence of
     actions to be performed. Huh?? Basically, it's a series of steps that you take to reach a
     very specific goal. So, don't worry about content or styling in this extra challenge-
     think about the way your code functions when a user interacts with it.</p>
     <br />
     <p><em class="bold underline">Think about it- your life is a series of algorithms.</em></p>
     <br />
     <p>For example, you have an algorithm you follow every time
     you brush your teeth. Go into the bathroom, grab your toothbrush, turn on the water,
     wet your toothbrush, turn off the water, put toothpaste on your toothbrush,
     brush those beautiful teeth, etc. It's as easy as that! Well, easy may sometimes be an overstatement...
     <a href="http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~jrbirge/html/dholmes/StoProIntro.html" target="_blank">Oy...</a></p>
     <br />
     <p>Algorithms can get pretty complicated, but they're not always <em>that</em> complicated. Take a few minutes to think about some of
     the algorithms that dominate your life. What is your algorithm for having dinner?
     What is the algorithm you follow just to turn on your computer?</p>
     <br />
     <p>Algorithms are <em class="underline">very</em> helpful in programming. Like, do you see
     the &lsaquo;em&rsaquo; tag and underline class that I'm using to emphasize how helpful they are?? They are the recipes that you can use to create
     your fantastic programs. They will help you build the foundation of code that you need for your site and make it applicable to many different situations. For
     example, if Laura and Kate have the same tooth-brushing routine, you can use that
     one tooth-brushing algorithm to represent that process for both people. A more generic example is that you can use an
     algorithm to calculate the number of days a person has been alive since their
     date of birth. So, you would take any one person's date of birth and figure out how many
     days that person has existed since today's date. Or you can sort a random series of numbers from the
     smallest to the largest. What would be an interesting algorithm that you could create based on your life?</p>
     <br />
     <p>By creating an algorithm, you will save time programming, and
     your code will be D.R.Y.- Don't Repeat Yourself. If you're interested, look up DRY programming.</p>
     <br />
     <p>We'll start you off with a cool JavaScript algorithm.</p>
     <br />
     <p><span class="uppercase">Here's the challenge:</span> you are going to have a user enter her or his name
     into the form below. When the user puts their name into the form, you will have an
     algorithm that displays their name spelled backwards.</p>
     <br />
     <p>What makes this an algorithm? Well, we want the code to do the same
       thing every time a name/string is entered into the input field. We want
       consistency when our code responds to the users' input.</p>
       <br />
       <p> Here are some things to think about as you're fixing this code:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>You need to make sure the user name is saved as a variable</li>
       <li>Look into jQuery methods (a method is a built-in function) that can manipulate
       strings</li>
       <li>Review what 'method chaining' means- putting one method after another- it's very helpful! <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_chaining.asp" target="_blank">Look here!</a></li>
       <li>You will need a method that can cut a word into individual letters <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp" target="_blank"> like here</a></li>
       <li>Another method that you may need would swap all of the letters from their original place <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reverse.asp" target="_blank">like here</a></li>
       <li>Another method could put those individual letters back together to create another string <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_join.asp" target="_blank">like here</a></li>
       <li>There are two JavaScript functions here that you can fix. Try the first one, and then go on to the second one if you'd like.  We can chat
       about these a bit in our next meeting!</li>
