# bugathon-html

This project will allow ninjas to build their HTML skills by debugging an HTML document and teaches them the importance of this skill as a developer.  

First, ninjas are presented with specific HTML elements that they must debug. Then, they have an opportunity to put all
of their knowledge together to find and correct the mistakes in a section that puts together all of the elements they 
debugged before.

The Master branch will contain the "clean" code without any mistakes.

TBD- another branch with contain the code with mistakes, and another branch will contain code that displays the mistakes
so mentors know where the errors live in the document.
